# Fine fune GPT2 to generate story
Fine-tune GPT-2 with reddit prompts and stories dataset from  [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04833). The fine-tuned model decreases the perplexity evaluated on valid dataset from 39 to 24, which is a great improvement. You can also check and run my python3 notebook on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/emily2008/fine-tune-gpt-2-to-generate-stories)
